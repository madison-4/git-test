# About
This was my very first use of git.
I am looking at a way to automate the git add, commit and push
To that end the script, commit was born
## commit.sh
This is the file ti use when commiting your files
It works by asuming a preset connection to the github account

# Contributions.
You are all encouraged to share your updates and contributions to this script
For now it assumes the repo is connected to github, and it has no way to check for errors
